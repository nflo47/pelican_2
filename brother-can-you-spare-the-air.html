<h1>Brother, can you spare the&nbsp;air?</h1>

<p>As firefighters <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/communications_statewidefiresummary.php">finally are able to contain</a> the still 9 ongoing wildfires that have ravaged the Lake in Calaveras counties this month, I find myself reflecting on the men and women working to bring equanimity to the foothills of the Sierras.&nbsp;I </p>
<p>At times this summer more than 10,000  people collectively worked to up and down the state from Southern Califormia all the way up to Trinity National Forest.  Cal Fire and civilian volunteers make up the majoirti, but approximately <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34285658">one-third</a>
are inmates from low to medium security prisons.  Considering how overcrowded prisons are in the state, it is a resourceful way to allow these prisoners the ability to gain a unique, rehabilitative experience outside the suffocating walls of the prison yard.&nbsp;In</p>

<p>Regardless of the firefighter’s personal journey to the incinerated lands consuming our drought-stricken landscape, they all ore unified by the threats of falling trees and the historical circumstances they fund themselves in.       when working on these long he, I’m reminded of Philip Levine’s poem, “Fire,” where he describes the physical and mental ramifactions of battling these blazes.  It’s hard and exhausting work on&nbsp;these </p>
<p><em>A fire burns along the eastern rim</em><br />
<em>of mountains. In the valley we</em><br />
<em>see it as a celestial prank, for</em><br />
<em>in the summer haze the mountains</em>  <br />
<em>themselves are lost, but as the night</em>  <br />
<em>deepens the fire grows more golden</em> <br />
<em>and dense. On this calm ground</em> <br />
<em>the raw raging of burning winds</em>  <br />
<em>that cuts the eyes and singes the hair</em>  <br />
<em>is seen as a pencil-line of light</em>  <br />
<em>moving southward. I know my son</em>  <br />
<em>is there, has been for four days,</em>  <br />
<em>moved in and out by helicopters</em>  <br />
<em>with his squad of fire fighters.</em>  <br />
<em>By now, without sleep, they&#8217;ve</em>  <br />
<em>gone beyond exhaustion. Some can&#8217;t</em>  <br />
<em>waken, some are crazed, a few</em><br />
<em>go on&#8212; the oldest&#8212; working steadily.</em>  <br />
<em>I know this from the stories he</em><br />
<em>has told me of other famous fires</em><br />
<em>from which he returned as from</em><br />
<em>a dream, his eyes glazed with seeing,</em><br />
<em>his time and place gone.</em><br />
<em>He would raise his shaking right arm</em><br />
<em>above his head, and with his palm</em><br />
<em>open sweep it toward me again</em><br />
<em>and again and speak without grammar,</em><br />
<em>sometimes without words, of what</em><br />
<em>had taken place. I knew it was true.</em><br />
<em>Now in the cool of the evening I catch</em><br />
<em>a hint of the forest, of that taking</em><br />
<em>of sudden breath that pines demand;</em><br />
<em>it&#8217;s on my skin, a light oil, a sweat</em><br />
<em>born of some forgotten leaning into&nbsp;fire.</em>  </p>
<p>In these expansive terrains that make up the Western United States, forest fires may be a distant thought.  “In the valley we see it as a celestial prank, for
in the summer haze the mountains themselves are lost,” shows the disconnect someone may have from these fires while in the city or valley. The hazy sun distorts the conception of climate change, but then you “catch a hint of the forst” while looking out at the smoke-stained clounds on the Eastern horizon, and it spurs the realization of the&nbsp;country’s </p>
